# Security Policy

## Important announcement regarding 1.x.x's security:

1.x.x is reaching its EOL. Past the 6th of May, the 1Host team will no longer support 1.x.x for all kinds of updates, including security vulnerability fixes. We will also no longer be merging any PRs. It is strongly recommended that you move to [2.x.x](https://github.com/1hostjs/hosting) before this date. 

To update, simply run the following command in your terminal again:

    npm install @1hostjs/hosting

If for some reason you want to keep using 1.x.x, you may do so, but it is strongly discouraged as important problems such as security vulnerabilities can arise, and they will not be fixed.

Also, you'll be unable to fresh install 1.x.x since its NPM package has been removed, so you can only use it if you installed it before its EOL was announced.
