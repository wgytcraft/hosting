# Security Policy

## Important announcement regarding 1.x.x's security:

1.x.x is reaching its EOL. Past the 6th of May, the 1Host team will no longer support 1.x.x for all kinds of updates, including security vulnerability fixes. We will also no longer be merging any PRs. It is strongly recommended that you move to [2.x.x](https://github.com/1hostjs/hosting) before this date. 

To update, simply run the following command in your terminal again:
```
npm install @1hostjs/hosting
```
If for some reason you want to keep using 1.x.x, you may do so, but it is strongly discouraged as important problems such as security vulnerabilities can arise, and they will not be fixed.

We are working on a compatibility layer so 1.x.x modules work on 2.x.x and you can look at progress [here](https://github.com/1hostjs/1.0compatibilitylayer).
