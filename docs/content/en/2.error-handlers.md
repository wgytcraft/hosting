- Make a folder in the modules folder called whatever you want
- Add a file called `index.js`
- Add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = function (
  host,
  res,
  req,
  errornumber,
  errordesc,
  version,
  ejs,
  options
) {
  res.write("Error");
  res.end();
};
```

- In the blank space add your own [http module](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-http-module) code, some select express res. functions, you can also get the host, get the error code, error description, get the version, and use ejs.
- Import the module by adding the folder name to modules.json by adding `local://foldername` to moduleList and adding `"yoursite"` to errorHandler
- Run `index.js`
- It should work!
